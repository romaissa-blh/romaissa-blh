- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "debugging" in software development originated from an actual insect? In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She literally removed the moth and taped it to the logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found." So, next time you're debugging your code, just remember, it's not always a metaphorical bug causing the issue!
